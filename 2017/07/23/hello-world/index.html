</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The first Python tutorial I did was a Hello world example. Since then I've used the phrase many more times to test out new setups, always a cheerful 'Hello world!' as first broadcast. It seems fitting to follow the Wordpress suggestion and leave it as the title for this first post.</p>
<p>[python light="1"]<br>
print('Hello world!')<br>
[/python]</p>
<p>I named this blog All Time Free Time. For now, at least. The reason is that I believe people are in control of their lives. That they are free to choose how they want to spend their most precious resource: their time. I use the word 'believe' because maybe I want it to be so more than I think it is a reality for everyone.</p>
<p>Last week I saw a profile of a girl on a certain social app, with a text about her job and then about what she liked to do in her free time. Even though that's perfectly normal semantics it kind of triggered me and I felt the urge to shout to her: "All time is free time!"</p>
<p>Unfortunately I could not reach her, so calming myself and continuing swiping was all I could do. But the thought lingered. Maybe this is why I went the startup route; to take full responsibility for my time and actions.</p>
<p>There are probably many people who don't feel like they are masters of their own lives. For a large part of humanity every day is a struggle to get even their basic needs met. I hope at some point every person can pursue their intrinsic wants. That for everyone all time is free time.</p>
